# Query Routing Foundations: Building a Cohesive RAG System

### Key Insight

**The best retriever is multiple retrievers—success = P(selecting right retriever) × P(retriever finding data).** Query routing isn't about choosing one perfect system. It's about building a portfolio of specialized tools and letting a smart router decide. Start simple with few-shot classification, then evolve to fine-tuned models as you collect routing decisions.

## Introduction

## What This Chapter Covers

- Building unified RAG architectures with query routing
- Designing tool interfaces for specialized retrievers
- Implementing effective routing between components
- Measuring system-level performance

## The Query Routing Problem

In Chapter 5, we built specialized retrievers for different content types. Now we need to decide when to use each one.

**Query routing** means directing user queries to the right retrieval components. Without it, even excellent specialized retrievers become useless if they're never called for the right queries.

The architecture we'll build:

1. Uses specialized retrievers built from user segmentation data
2. Routes queries to appropriate components
3. Provides clear interfaces for both models and users
4. Collects feedback to improve routing accuracy

## Tools as APIs Pattern

Treat each specialized retriever as an API that language models can call. This creates separation between:

1. **Tool Interfaces**: Definitions of what each tool does and its parameters
2. **Tool Implementations**: The actual retrieval code
3. **Routing Logic**: Code that selects which tools to call

This is similar to building microservices, except the primary client is a language model rather than another service. The pattern evolved from simple function calling in LLM APIs to more sophisticated tool selection frameworks.

### Benefits of the API Approach

- **Clear Boundaries**: Teams work independently on different tools
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Tools work for both LLMs and direct API calls
- **Scalability**: Add new capabilities without changing existing code
- **Performance**: Enable parallel execution
- **Team Structure**: Different teams own different components

!!! example "Organizational Structure"
One effective team structure:
\- **Interface Team**: Designs the API contracts and tool specifications based on user needs
\- **Implementation Team**: Builds and optimizes individual retrievers for specific content types
\- **Router Team**: Creates and optimizes the query routing system
\- **Evaluation Team**: Tests the performance of the entire system and identifies bottlenecks

    C --> E[Image Tool]

    D --> G[Ranking]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[Context Assembly]
    H --> I[Response Generation]
    I --> J[User Interface]
```

This architecture resembles modern microservice patterns where specialized services handle specific tasks. The difference is that the "client" making API calls is often a language model rather than another service.

### Moving from Monolithic to Modular

Most RAG systems start monolithic: one vector database, one chunking strategy, one retrieval method. This breaks down as content types diversify.

Typical migration path:

1. **Recognition**: Different queries need different retrieval
2. **Separation**: Break into specialized components
3. **Interface**: Define clear contracts between components
4. **Orchestration**: Build routing layer

**Example**: A financial services client migrated from a single vector database to specialized components:

- Development velocity: 40% faster feature delivery
- Retrieval quality: 25-35% improvement by query type
- Team coordination: Fewer cross-team dependencies
- Scaling: New content types added without disrupting existing features

The key was treating each retriever as a service with a clear API contract.
