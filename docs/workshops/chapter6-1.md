# Query Routing Foundations: Building a Cohesive RAG System

### Key Insight

**The best retriever is multiple retrievers—success = P(selecting right retriever) × P(retriever finding data).** Query routing isn't about choosing one perfect system. It's about building a portfolio of specialized tools and letting a smart router decide. Start simple with few-shot classification, then evolve to fine-tuned models as you collect routing decisions.

## Introduction

## What This Chapter Covers

- Building unified RAG architectures with query routing
- Designing tool interfaces for specialized retrievers
- Implementing effective routing between components
- Measuring system-level performance

## The Query Routing Problem

In Chapter 5, we built specialized retrievers for different content types. Now we need to decide when to use each one.

**Query routing** means directing user queries to the right retrieval components. Without it, even excellent specialized retrievers become useless if they're never called for the right queries.

The architecture we'll build:

1. Uses specialized retrievers built from user segmentation data
2. Routes queries to appropriate components
3. Provides clear interfaces for both models and users
4. Collects feedback to improve routing accuracy

## Tools as APIs Pattern

Treat each specialized retriever as an API that language models can call. This creates separation between:

1. **Tool Interfaces**: Definitions of what each tool does and its parameters
2. **Tool Implementations**: The actual retrieval code
3. **Routing Logic**: Code that selects which tools to call

This is similar to building microservices, except the primary client is a language model rather than another service. The pattern evolved from simple function calling in LLM APIs to more sophisticated tool selection frameworks.

### Benefits of the API Approach

- **Clear Boundaries**: Teams work independently on different tools
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Tools work for both LLMs and direct API calls
- **Scalability**: Add new capabilities without changing existing code
- **Performance**: Enable parallel execution
- **Team Structure**: Different teams own different components

### Team Organization for Scalable Development

When building these systems at scale, team organization becomes critical. From my experience developing multiple microservices for retrieval at different companies, successful teams organize around these boundaries:

!!! example "Organizational Structure"
    **Interface Team** (Product/API Design)
    - Designs tool specifications based on user research
    - Defines the contracts between components  
    - Decides what capabilities to expose
    - Manages the user experience across tools

    **Implementation Teams** (Engineering)
    - **Search Team**: Builds document and text retrievers
    - **Vision Team**: Handles blueprint and image search
    - **Structured Data Team**: Manages schedule and metadata search
    - Each team optimizes their specific retriever type

    **Router Team** (ML Engineering)  
    - Builds and optimizes the query routing system
    - Manages few-shot examples and prompt engineering
    - Handles tool selection accuracy measurement

    **Evaluation Team** (Data Science)
    - Tests end-to-end system performance
    - Identifies bottlenecks between routing and retrieval
    - Runs A/B tests and measures user satisfaction

### Why This Structure Works

This separation allows teams to work independently while maintaining system coherence:

- **Clear ownership**: Each team owns specific metrics and outcomes
- **Parallel development**: Teams can optimize their components simultaneously  
- **Scalable expertise**: Teams develop deep knowledge in their domain
- **Clean interfaces**: Teams coordinate through well-defined APIs

**You're effectively becoming a framework developer for language models.** Moving forward, building RAG systems will feel a lot like building distributed microservices, where each service specializes in a particular type of information retrieval.

    A[User Query] --> B[Query Router]
    B --> C[Tool Selection]
    C --> D[Document Tool]
    C --> E[Image Tool]
    C --> F[Table Tool]
    D --> G[Ranking]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[Context Assembly]
    H --> I[Response Generation]
    I --> J[User Interface]
```

This architecture resembles modern microservice patterns where specialized services handle specific tasks. The difference is that the "client" making API calls is often a language model rather than another service.

### Moving from Monolithic to Modular

Most RAG systems start monolithic: one vector database, one chunking strategy, one retrieval method. This breaks down as content types diversify.

Typical migration path:

1. **Recognition**: Different queries need different retrieval
2. **Separation**: Break into specialized components
3. **Interface**: Define clear contracts between components
4. **Orchestration**: Build routing layer

**Example**: A financial services client migrated from a single vector database to specialized components:

- Development velocity: 40% faster feature delivery
- Retrieval quality: 25-35% improvement by query type
- Team coordination: Fewer cross-team dependencies
- Scaling: New content types added without disrupting existing features

The key was treating each retriever as a service with a clear API contract.
