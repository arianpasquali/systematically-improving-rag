## Course Overview

This course teaches you how to systematically improve RAG applications through:

- Data-driven evaluation and metrics
- Embedding fine-tuning and optimization
- Query understanding and routing
- Structured data integration
- Production deployment strategies

### The RAG Flywheel

The core philosophy centers around the "RAG Flywheel" - a continuous improvement cycle that emphasizes:

1. **Measure**: Establish benchmarks and evaluation metrics
2. **Analyze**: Understand failure modes and user patterns
3. **Improve**: Apply targeted optimizations
4. **Iterate**: Continuous refinement based on real-world usage

2. **Data-Driven Improvement**: Using metrics, evaluations, and user feedback to guide development
3. **Systematic Approach**: Moving from ad-hoc tweaking to structured improvement processes
4. **User-Centered Design**: Focusing on user value and experience, not just technical capabilities
5. **Continuous Learning**: Building systems that improve with every interaction

To build and view the documentation:

```bash

mkdocs serve

# Build static documentation
mkdocs build
```

## Getting Started

### Important: Use the `latest/` Directory

**‚ö†Ô∏è Always work in the `latest/` directory for the most current course content.**

The `cohort_1/` and `cohort_2/` directories contain materials from previous course iterations and are kept for reference only. All new development and course work should be done in `latest/`.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 (required - the project uses specific features from this version)
- `uv` package manager (recommended) or `pip`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `latest/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd latest/
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv install

   # Or using pip
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Start with `week0/` for the most up-to-date content
5. Follow the notebooks in sequential order within each week
6. Reference the corresponding book chapters in `/docs` for deeper understanding

### Code Quality

Before committing changes, run:

```bash
# Format and fix code issues
uv run ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- **Systematic Improvement**: Data-driven approaches over guesswork
- **Product Thinking**: Building RAG systems that solve real problems
- **Practical Application**: Real-world datasets and examples
- **Evaluation-First**: Measure before and after every change
- **Continuous Learning**: The field evolves rapidly; the flywheel helps you adapt

## Additional Resources

- Industry talk transcripts in `/data/`
- Office hours recordings summaries in `/docs/office_hours/`
- Advanced notebooks in `/latest/extra_kura/` for clustering and classification topics
- Complete case study implementation in `/latest/case_study/`
