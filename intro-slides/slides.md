# About Me (Jason Liu)

- University of Waterloo (2012–2017):
  - Computational Mathematics, Mathematical Physics
  - Computational linear algebra → compression/embedding models → retrieval and deep learning
- Meta (2017):
  - Content policy/moderation, public risk & safety
  - Built dashboards and search tools to surface harmful content
- Stitch Fix (2018–2023):
  - CV + multimodal retrieval
  - VAEs/GANs for GenAI
  - ~$50M incremental revenue
  - led ~$400K/yr data curation for next‑gen models

---

# Consulting and Training

- Personal note: Hand injury (2021–2022) → shifted focus to higher‑leverage teaching and advising
- Consulting (2023–present): Query understanding, prompts, embedding search, fine‑tuning, MLOps/observability; upgrading legacy workflows to agentic systems
- Clients: HubSpot, Zapier, Limitless, and others across assistants, construction, research

---

# Format & Office Hours

- Inverted classroom: ~6 hours pre‑recorded lectures + tutorial videos
- Tutorials/Notebooks: Jupyter exercises to tackle between sessions
- Slack: post questions in the cohort channel for async help
- Welcome to share your learnings online via linked in or twitter (please link back to us some how)

<v-click>

## Office hours:

- bring your problems, introduce yourself.
- treat it like a tech‑lead review of your work
- cameras on is really appreciated! helps me a lot.
- Guest lectures: 1-2 times a week, practitioners actively building in the space.

## Logistics

- Scheduling: occasional reschedules (e.g., OpenAI Dev Day); advance notice
- Credits/support: contact Marian — support at jxnl.co (support@jxnl.co)

# Key Insights & Course Outcomes

This course will give you the foundations and practical skills to build, evaluate, and operate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Here’s what to keep in mind and what you’ll learn:

### Keep these in mind

- Good retrieval will often beat clever prompting.
- Similarity is subjective, train for your specific goals.
- Feedback is fuel, design your UX to capture useful signals.
- Specialized indices often outperform one-size-fits-all solutions (though this is shifting as contexts/tools evolve).
- Segmenting queries and users to prioritize work and build a roadmap.
- Production matters, cache, monitor, and degrade gracefully.

# The Models are Good but Context Is the Bottleneck

<v-click>

- Models are already very capable for work.
- Even if models hold steady, apps can still improve.
- With the right context, success rates are very high.
- The real challenge is getting that context — the R in retrieval.

# What’s Changed Since v1 (2024)

Lets talk more about this in the office hours!

- Since Claude 3.5, tools/agents are much more reliable; planning loops keep improving
- Code assistants (e.g., Claude Code) excel at code RAG flows: grep + edit with validation
- Prompt caching widespread; longer contexts change cost/latency tradeoffs
- Better PDF/diagram extraction; richer citations in UIs (bounding boxes)
- Shift from one‑off evals to continuous testing and monitoring over time
- Always a tradeoff: performance × latency × cost; be mindful of pricing impacts
- “Context engineering” is emerging; 2026 update of this course will focus more here

---

# Syllabus (Sessions 0–3)

- Session 0: Product mindset; RAG as a recommender; improvement flywheel
- Session 1: Synthetic data and retrieval evals; precision/recall; baselines
- Session 2: From evals to training data; reranking; embedding fine-tuning
- Session 3: UX that collects data; streaming; chain of thought; validation
  - Pacing note: Week 3 is intentionally lighter—use it to catch up and get ahead
  - Focus on UX patterns; not the most critical week content‑wise

<v-click>

## Main takeaway

- fast retrieval evals (precision/recall on key chunks)
- rerank/fine‑tune to get a 10-20% improvement
- deploy and collect real data via UX

</v-click>

---

# Syllabus (Sessions 4–6)

- Session 4: Topic modeling; query segmentation; prioritization frameworks
- Session 5: Specialized indices; multimodal search (docs, images, tables, SQL)
- Session 6: Query routing; tools-as-APIs; single vs multi-agent; measurement
  - Week 6 is lighter; focus on routing and preview the context‑engineering direction

<v-click>

## Main takeaway

- Figure out whats important to you and your users
- Build specialized indices for those usecases
- Make sure the Agent is able to use the specialized indices
